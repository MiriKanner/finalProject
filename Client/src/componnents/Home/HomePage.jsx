          This site helps you save stories, videos, icons, achievements and
          photos about your children. With our help, you can give your children
          memories and preserve a great childhood experience. In future years,
          when your child turns 18, he will be able to open his personal account
          and see and edit his photos. The beautiful albums you made for him
          will tell him about the huge love and endless investment you gave
          without limits all the years of his childhood. By editing these memory
          albums, you provide him with a special futuristic experience and an
          exciting preservation of his childhood experiences and achievements.
